          <p class="text-text-muted mb-4">
            E-Bike Field Guide is an affiliate marketing website. This means that when you click on certain links on our site and make a purchase, we may earn a commission at no additional cost to you. This disclosure is required by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and is part of our commitment to transparency.
          </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How Affiliate Links Work</h2>
        <p class="text-text-muted mb-6">
          When you click on a link to Amazon or another retailer from our website, a tracking cookie is placed in your browser. If you make a purchase within a certain timeframe (typically 24 hours for Amazon), we receive a small percentage of the sale as a commission. This comes out of the retailer's profit margin, not from your pocket.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Editorial Independence</h2>
        <p class="text-text-muted mb-6">
          Our reviews and recommendations are based on thorough research, hands-on testing, and genuine expert opinion. We never accept payment for positive reviews, and our editorial decisions are made independently of any affiliate relationships. If a product does not meet our standards, we will tell you even if it means losing a potential commission.
        </p>
