          Consider your e-bike's frame type, the weight of your rifle, and the terrain you'll be hunting. Hardtail bikes work well with rear-mounted racks, while full-suspension models may need frame-mounted options. Always check weight capacity and ensure the rack is compatible with your specific rifle configuration. We recommend testing the mounting system before heading into the field.

          Yes, but only if they're specifically designed for e-bike use. Look for systems with vibration dampening and secure locking mechanisms. Standard boat or car rod holders often fail under trail vibration. We've tested models that successfully protect expensive fly rods through miles of technical singletrack, but avoid cheap plastic mounts that can crack under stress.

        <div class="pt-4 text-lg text-text-muted">
          Most e-bikes can safely handle 40-80 pounds of additional gear, but check your manufacturer's specifications. Distribute weight evenly and keep heavy items low and centered. Remember that cargo weight affects battery range and handling, especially on steep terrain. Start with lighter loads and gradually increase as you get comfortable with your bike's performance characteristics.

          Invest in waterproof panniers or dry bags for essential gear. Even "water-resistant" bags can fail in heavy rain. We recommend double-bagging electronics and important documents. Consider waterproof cases for GPS units and phones, and always pack a small towel for drying equipment before storage. Remember that rain can add significant weight to fabric bags, affecting your bike's handling.

          It depends on the manufacturer and type of modification. Most companies allow non-structural additions like racks and mounts, but drilling into the frame often voids the warranty. Check your owner's manual and contact your dealer before making permanent modifications. Consider removable mounting systems that don't require drilling if warranty protection is important to you.

          Heavy gear can reduce your e-bike's range by 20-40%, depending on terrain and riding style. A typical 50-mile range might drop to 30-40 miles with full hunting or fishing gear. Plan accordingly and consider carrying a backup battery for extended trips. Remember that steep terrain and headwinds further reduce range, so always plan with a safety margin when accessing remote areas.

        <div class="pt-4 text-lg text-text-muted">
          Beyond standard hunting or fishing gear, carry a comprehensive first aid kit, emergency communication device (satellite messenger for remote areas), repair kit for your e-bike, extra water and food, and appropriate weather protection. Always tell someone your planned route and expected return time. A GPS unit with backup batteries is essential for navigation in areas with poor cell service.

          Use high-quality cable locks through both your gear and bike frame when leaving your e-bike unattended. Consider removable racks that you can take with you. For expensive firearms, transfer them to a hard case when leaving the bike. GPS trackers can provide additional security for high-value equipment. Never leave your gear unattended for extended periods in remote areas.
